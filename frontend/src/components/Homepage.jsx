              <p>
                The BBB-DEX (short for Blood-Brain Barrier Differential Expression eXplorer - or the BBB inDEX) resource aims to provide a reference for 
                differentially expressed genes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) - with a special emphasis on genes posessing transmembrane helices - in order 
                to facilitate future research concerned with finding therapeutic targets on the BBB for drug delivery to the brain. It was created by combining
                a total of 264 publicly available healthy bulk RNA-Seq samples from 63 studies encompassing 16 different tissues including the BBB. To create the resource, 
                various configurations for differential gene expression testing (employing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DESeq2</a> & <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02648-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WRST</a> as 
                statistical tests) and <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA)</a> were 
                used alongside other minor additions.

              <p>
                Source code for the website is available under the GitHub repository for users who wish to keep a local copy of the resource.
                Similarly, raw result lists can be accessed as part of the source code for additional analyses if needed. For contact and support,
                use either the GitHub issues page or the contact addresses under the <i><b>Support</b></i> tab. Finally, the website was not designed to
                be used with mobile devices, so additional bugs may be present.
