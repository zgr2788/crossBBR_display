            This section includes the merged results tables for all possible combinations of the following 3 binary conditions: the statistical test performed 
            (marked by <i><b>DESeq2</b></i> or <i><b>WRST</b></i>), whether the genes of interest were overexpressed or underexpressed in BBB samples 
            (marked by <i><b>UP</b></i> or <i><b>DN</b></i>), and whether all of the data or select tissues were considered during testing 
            (marked by <i><b>Subset</b></i>). Use the tabs to navigate between lists.
